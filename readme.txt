WordPress Course Manager - a WordPress Plugin to handle courses, lecturers and a schedule of dates when courses are held with one or more lecturer(s).

== Description ==
WordPress Course Manager - a WordPress Plugin to handle courses, lecturers and a schedule of dates when courses are held with one or more lecturer(s).

The plugin lets you manage:

* Lecturers - Name, biography, picture and homepage url.
* Courses - Name, description, lecturers
* Schedule - Course, date, place, url to page/file with more information.

The plugin has very basic styling with css, relying mostly on the current theme to style things like typography, margins, paddings and so on. The plugin style is made to be responsive (works well on both small and big screens) and tested with the default 2013 theme.

Javascript is required to be enabled in the browser for the schedule page to work

This plugin was developed since I couldn't find any other plugin that provided this functionality, and I needed it for the home page of the Swedish educational company Utbildningsgl√§dje (http://www.utbildningsgladje.nu).

What I needed was to manage lecturers that can hold different courses and create a schedule with courses to be held at different locations.



== Installation ==

How to install WP Course Manager:

1. Upload the folder `WP Course Manager` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add information about lecturers, courses and their scheduled events in WP Course Manager settings. 
4. Create 3 pages where the following shortcodes should be placed:
   * [wpcm_lecturers] to list all lecturers
   * [wpcm_courses] to list all courses
   * [wpcm_schedule] to list the schedule
5. In the plugin settings, set what pages contain the different shortcodes.
